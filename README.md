# Linked List Implementation in C#

## Project Description
This project is an implementation of the **Linked List** data structure using **C#**. It was developed to help understand the core concepts of Linked Lists, including how to manage nodes and perform basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal. 

The project demonstrates the use of Linked Lists for various purposes such as adding elements at the beginning, end, and specific positions, and removing elements from the list. It also implements traversal for displaying the elements in the list.

## Technologies Used
- **C#** (Programming language)
- **.NET Framework** (For development environment)

## Features
- **Insert at the beginning, end, and specific positions** in the Linked List.
- **Delete** elements from the Linked List.
- **Traversal** to display all elements of the Linked List.
- Basic **Linked List operations** including adding, removing, and searching for elements.
